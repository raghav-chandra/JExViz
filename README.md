# JExViz
Java Exception Visualizer

JExViz is a tool that can be injected in your JVM without changing your code, and it will start collecting information around Exception occurred in your JVM. 
Collected data then will be send to Store. JexViz will come with a UI that will pull data from the ExceptionStore and render it in a browser. 
Now you can actually see why an exception occurred in your JVM and no analysis is required for Exceptions.
